2016, October 02: v0.3.2-RUNE
Miner's tax is disabled by default. The more people using the RUNE edition, the lower the miner's tax becomes. No rule changes have been made, this leveraged the existing voting mechanism CryptoZoidberg implemented.

Note: If you vote to enable the miner's tax, the proceeds still go to an account controlled by Zoidberg
